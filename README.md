# INT 1.2: Concurrent Sort Benchmark

## Description

This project is the **frontend (only)** of a Golang benchmarking app. The intended function is to demonstrate how concurrency (Goroutines) can save processing time. This is shown by sorting a set of arrays (once synchronously and once concurrently and then comparing how long each operation took.

The backend has not been developed yet! In other words, the intended function is yet to be implemented.

Keep an eye out for the end-product! ðŸ˜Š

## Usage

Follow the on-screen prompts in the app's `Configuration` section
